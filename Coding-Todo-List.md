Here's at a glance the roadmap

- Admin API / UI
  - 2 stores with 2 different sets of aisles
- Backend caching ✓
  - Add UI to clear all cache ✓
- Backend error handling
  - Send better messages back when failing in the api
  - first getting the error handling improved, then make it so the table for Grocery Item needs unique combo of name and categoryId (so can have 2 of same name but different categoryId)
- Auth (Clerk)
  - Update the 'updatedby' properties to populate from logged-in user
- Build Shopping List (DB/UI)
- Deploy site
  - Deploy DB
  - Deploy Server
  - Deploy FrontEnd
  - Redis Cloud for server-side caching
