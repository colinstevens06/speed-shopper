Here's at a glance the roadmap

- Admin API / UI
  - 2 stores with 2 different sets of aisles
    - I have 1 right now ✓
- Backend caching ✓
  - Add UI to clear all cache ✓
- Backend error handling ✓
  - Send better messages back when failing in the api ✓
  - first getting the error handling improved, then make it so the table for Grocery Item needs unique combo of name and categoryId (so can have 2 of same name but different categoryId)
- Auth (Clerk)
  - Update the 'updatedby' properties to populate from logged-in user
- JWT Cookies for Auth ✓
- DB Auth (when going to Prod)
- Server Auth / HTTP ✓
- Build Shopping List (DB/UI)
  - UI ✓ (mostly done)
  - DB ✓
  - API ✓
- Deploy site
  - Deploy DB

  - Deploy FrontEnd
